Failed to compile.

Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'process/browser' in 'C:\Users\rajub\OneDrive\Desktop\aiXfn\node_modules\axios\lib'
Did you mean 'browser.js'?
BREAKING CHANGE: The request 'process/browser' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
Add the extension to the request.
